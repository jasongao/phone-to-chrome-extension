###[Phone to Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ojoecolejmnhkgafjnieigpjhgmpllnn)

[The app allows you to send links from your Android phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amaan.phonetochrome) to Chrome on your desktop.

The project is made of 3 parts, the app, the extension, and the server which connects the app to the extension.
